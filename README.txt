Programming Language Classifier uses supervised learning technique to classify a given snippet of program to which language it belongs to.

It uses http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bayesian_spam_filtering technique and figures out the probability of the given snippet to every programming language trained to the system.


It is just a fun project built during my Introduction to Machine Learning course during Spring 2013 at UIC.
